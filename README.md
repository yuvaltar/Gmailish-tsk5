## Overview

Gmailish-tsk4 is a comprehensive **full-stack messaging platform** that brings together the robust backend from task 3 with a modern React frontend. This Gmail-inspired application delivers a complete user experience with **real-time messaging**, **intelligent spam filtering**, and **responsive design**. The system combines a **RESTful Node.js backend**, a **dynamic React frontend**, and a **high-performance C++ Bloom Filter service** for URL blacklisting - all orchestrated through **Docker** for seamless deployment and scalability.

## Features

**üé® Modern User Interface**
- **Dark mode and light mode toggle**
- **Responsive sidebar** with collapse functionality (hamburger menu)
- **Gmail-inspired design** and layout
- **Real-time updates** without page refreshes

**üìß Email Management**
- **Complete inbox management** with read/unread status
- **Label-based organization** system
- **Default labels**: Starred, Archived, Deleted, Drafts, and more
- **Pagination system** (50 mails per page with navigation arrows)
- **Email composition** and editing capabilities

**üõ°Ô∏è Security & Authentication**
- **JWT-based authentication** with 2-hour session duration
- **Strong password requirements** (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
- **Username uniqueness validation**
- **Secure user registration** and login

**üö´ Intelligent Spam Protection**
- **Advanced spam detection** using Bloom Filter technology
- **URL-based blacklisting** - emails containing flagged URLs automatically go to spam
- **Real-time spam classification** and filtering

**üë§ User Profile Management**
- **Profile picture upload** and display
- **Comprehensive user registration** with validation
- **Persistent user sessions** with JWT tokens

**‚ö° Performance & Scalability**
- **Component-based React architecture** for optimal rendering
- **Real-time data fetching** and updates
- **Modular backend** with RESTful API design

## Architecture

The system follows a modern **three-tier architecture**:

**Frontend Layer (React - Port 3001)**
- **Component-based UI** with pages and reusable components
- **State management** using React hooks
- **Real-time communication** with backend APIs
- **Responsive design** with theme switching capabilities

**Backend Layer (Express.js - Port 3000)**
- **RESTful API server** handling all business logic
- **JWT-based authentication** middleware
- **In-memory data storage** for users, emails, and labels
- **Integration with Bloom Filter** service for spam detection

**Filter Service Layer (C++ - Port 4000)**
- **High-performance Bloom Filter** implementation
- **TCP server** for URL blacklist management
- **Persistent blacklist data** storage
- **Real-time spam URL detection** and classification

## How It Works

The Gmailish platform orchestrates **seamless communication** between its three core services. Users interact with the **intuitive React frontend**, which communicates with the Express backend through **secure JWT-authenticated API calls**. The backend processes all **email operations**, **user management**, and **label organization** while consulting the **C++ Bloom Filter service** for **intelligent spam detection**. When emails are sent, **URLs within the content are analyzed** against the blacklist, and **suspicious emails are automatically routed** to the spam folder. The system maintains **session persistence** through JWT tokens, allowing users to stay logged in for up to **2 hours without re-authentication**.

## Supported API Routes

The backend maintains the same comprehensive RESTful API from task 3, including:

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and profile operations
- **Email Operations**: Send, receive, update, delete, and search functionality  
- **Label Management**: Create, update, delete, and organize email labels
- **Blacklist Control**: Add/remove URLs from spam detection system
- **Authentication**: JWT token generation and validation

All routes are secured with appropriate authentication middleware and input validation.

## Persistence

Currently, the application uses an in-memory storage system:
- **Application Data**: Users, emails, and labels are stored in memory on the web server
- **Blacklist Data**: Persistently stored by the Bloom Filter service to disk
- **Session Data**: JWT tokens manage user sessions with 2-hour expiration

*Note: Application data is reset upon server restart, while blacklist data persists across restarts.*

## Building and Running

### Local Development

**Prerequisites**: Node.js, npm, and a Linux environment for the C++ Bloom Filter service.

**1. Start the React Frontend:**

*cd react*

*npm start*


*Runs on port 3001

**2. Start the Express Backend:**

*cd server*

*node app.js*

*Runs on port 3000

**3. Start the Bloom Filter Service (Linux only):**

*cd src*

*g++ main.cpp BloomFilter/BloomFilter.cpp BloomFilter/BlackList.cpp BloomFilter/url.cpp server/server.cpp server/SessionHandler.cpp server/CommandManager.cpp -I. -IBloomFilter -Iserver -o cpp_server -pthread -std=gnu++17*

*./cpp_server 4000 1024 3 5*


*Runs on port 4000

### Access the Application
Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to access the Gmailish platform.

## Docker Setup

### Build and Run All Services
**Build and start all containers:**

*docker-compose up --build*

**Run without rebuilding:**

*docker-compose up*
